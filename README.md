# Sketchee

Simple shared drawing tool running on a browser. Main use case in mind is having meetings in work, or with friends and have always a convenient "white board" around.

Planned features:

* Collaborative: can be used in meetings to sketch/draw diagrams.
* Work well with tablets and pens/styluses.
* Variable resolution: drawing can be done at any resolution.
  * Hopefully this will help with relative low resolution styluses.
* Hopefully drawing will use SVG, and the sketches can be exported to SVG.
* Easy to copy&paste external images.
* Keyboard short-cuts for those using keyboards.
* Easy math formula (type "$" and the formula), using a latex backend.
* History of changes.
